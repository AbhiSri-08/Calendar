# Calendar Assignment

## Project Overview
This is a **React-based calendar application** that offers multiple calendar views — Year, Month, and Week — allowing users to add, view, edit, and manage tasks/events. The app features a sidebar with navigation and user account details, task management with title and description, and persistent storage using `localStorage`. The design emphasizes a clean, minimal, and user-friendly interface inspired by popular calendar apps.
